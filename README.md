# lunar_lockout

A solo Flutter project I'm doing to get familiar with Flutter and Dart. This should probably not be an example to anyone on how to write code in Flutter, since it's the first thing I've ever tried to build, but anyone who looks at (which realistically is gonna either be Alex or Jonas, Hey Alex or Jonas) is free (and encouraged) to tell me about anything they would do differently.
